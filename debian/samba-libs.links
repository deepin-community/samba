# libndr.so.X mess.  This library does not have stable ABI and can change.
# But it is used by other software (eg, sssd, openchange, evolution-mapi).
# openchange and evolution-mapi are not in debian (bullseye/bookworm).
# Only a small subset of the symbols is actually used.
# Since we package libndr.so.N inside samba-libs package, not inside its own
# libndrN package (because it links with all internal samba libs, and different
# libndrNs can't co-exist), we have to deal with the soname bumps somehow.

# 4.15 changed soname of libndr.so.1 in incompatible way and bumbed soname to .2
# Only small subset of symbols is actually used by sssd, neither of which were
# affected, so we can "assume" the ABI in .2 is "sufficienly compatible" with .1
# Provide compat symlink.
# This is a gross hack, but it let us to survive.
# Remove past bookworm.

# 4.17 changed soname of libndr without a reason, provide compat symlink
