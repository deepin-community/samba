This is an incomplete list of a number of issues that need to be fixed.

- make a list of basic tests that should be done to ensure that the package is
  acceptable for unstable (and run these tests)

- investigate impact of changes to libraries to reverse dependencies and plan
  transitions (if there are any).
  - sssd: uses libndr which changes soname without transition (semi-private lib)
    Especially painful for backports.
    We're now emitting proper soname for libndrN at least (before it was just part
    of samba-libs), so breakage will be at least visible before installing new
    samba-libs

- Add script to verify that headers are usable through current dependencies
  (to prevent bugs like #525888)

- Investigate which binaries should go to which packages:

  - Some libs and shared objects are specific to samba-ad-dc
    (eg usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/samba/service/kdc, ntp_signd)
  - dlz_*: should these go to samba-ad-dc too? multiarch dlz?
  - samba_kcc: where should it go?
  - samba-ad-client files: should samba-dnsupdate and samba-spnupdate
    be there?
