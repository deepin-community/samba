samba (2:4.20.1+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  The tool samba-tool (python-based) has been moved from samba-common-bin
  to python3-samba package.  This is to avoid dependency on python modules
  for minimal samba client installation.  If you rely on samba-tool, please
  ensure that the (optional in some configurations) python3-samba package is
  also installed.
